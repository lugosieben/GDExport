GDExport is a simple tool made for downloading the data of Geometry Dash levels.

## Usage

To use GDExport, simply type in the Level ID of your level into the input box.

I have made a simple level to use for this example with the id `87150545`

Click on the Button "Export to Files" and select the location for your file. Make sure to give it a `.txt` ending.
